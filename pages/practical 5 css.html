      Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed
      language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
      CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables
      you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. CSS is
      easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the
      presentation of an HTML document

      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation 
      of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology 
      of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
      and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control 
      in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
      specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
       
        content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages 
        that share the file and its formatting.

        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the 
        same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such 
        as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), 
        and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
        if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

      The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme 
      to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches 
      a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
